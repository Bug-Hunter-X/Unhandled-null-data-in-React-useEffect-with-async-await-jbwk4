# Unhandled Null Data in React useEffect with Async/Await

This example demonstrates a common error in React applications that use `useEffect` with `async/await` for data fetching. The component fetches data from an API and handles loading and error states correctly. However, it fails to handle the case where the API returns null data, leading to a potential runtime error when attempting to render the data.

## Bug

The `MyComponent` component uses `useEffect` to fetch data from `/api/data`. While it handles loading and error states, it does not explicitly check for null data before attempting to render it.  This oversight may result in errors such as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '... ')` if the API returns null or an empty object.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a check for null data before rendering to avoid any unexpected errors.  The updated component checks whether `data` is null or an empty object before attempting to render its content.  Appropriate fallback UI is also provided in case of null data.
